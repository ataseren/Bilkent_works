Codes for homework assignments of Bilkent University CS201 class (2020 Fall).

## HW1
In	this	homework,	you	will	implement	a	flight	reservation	system	for	an	airline	company,	which	
operates	multiple	flights.	Each	flight	has	a	unique	flight	number	and	is	operated	with	an	aircraft	
that	may	have	a	different	seating	plan.	According	to	its	type,	an	aircraft	has	a	specified	number	
of	 rows	 and	 number	 of	 seats	 in	 each	 row.	 (Although	 these	 numbers	 may	 change	 from	 one	
aircraft	type	to	another,	the	number	of	seats	is	the	same	for	every	row	in	the	same	aircraft.) You	
will	use	dynamically	allocated	arrays	for	this	purpose.

## HW2
In this homework, you will merge two sorted integer arrays. That is, given two sorted integer arrays arr1 and arr2 of
size N, the problem is to create and return a third sorted array arr3 with the items of arr1 and arr2. It will have
size 2N. Assume that sorting is done in ascending order of the integer items.
Two alternative algorithms that solve this problem are given below in lay terms. Each algorithm has a different time
complexity. The goal of this homework is to evaluate the growth rates of both algorithms using different inputs.
Algorithm 1: Append all items in arr1 in the same order to arr3. Then, for all items in arr2 starting from the
beginning, find the right place to insert in arr3 by shifting the items in arr3 if needed.
Algorithm 2: Compare pairs of numbers across arr1 and arr2 and insert the smallest to arr3. In this
algorithm you are allowed to visit every item only once.

## HW3
In this homework, you will implement a library system by using linked lists. The library system stores
information about students and books. The students will be able to check out books from the library
and will be able to return them to the library. For each student, the system stores an id, name, and a list
of books that she/he checked out. Each book is represented by its id, title, and year. You can assume
that there is a single copy of each book in the system.

## HW4
**(Code for this homework is incomplete. It doesn't run correctly, doesn't fulfill the requirements of the assignment. However, it can help you to solve similar problems.)**
In this homework, you will work on an extended version of the HPAir problem that we studied in the
class, which is also explained in Section 6.4 in your text book (Carrano’s book, 6’th edition). In this
assignment, we will provide you with a directed flight graph that shows the connections between cities.
A connection between two cities consists of a "flight id" and a "cost". By using this flight graph, your
program must find all possible paths (sequences of flights) between the given departure and destination
cities. It also should find the least cost path among all paths.
