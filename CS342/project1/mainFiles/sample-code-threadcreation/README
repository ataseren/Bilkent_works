This is a sample code that shows how to create and use threads.

To compile the program type:
   make

To run the program, you type:
  ./cthread  <numthreads> <min> <max>

The number of threads that will be created is <numthreads>.

Each thread will create an output file and will write  integers from <min> to <max> into that file.

To clean, type:
   make clean
