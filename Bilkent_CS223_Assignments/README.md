# Bilkent CS223 Assignments (Fall 2020)
Works for assignments of CS223 class of Bilkent University.

**I used Vivado software to write, synthesize and implement these codes. I used Xilinx Basys3 Development Kit to test these codes.**

(Lab 1 didn't involve any codes)

## Lab 2
Implementation of full adder, full subtractor and 2-bit adder with testbenches.

## Lab 3
Implementation of 2-to-4 decoder, 4-to-1 multiplexer and 8-to-1 multiplexer using 4-to-1 mux modules and few logic gates, and all of their testbenches

## Lab 4
Implementation of a traffic light system using FSM and a clock divider module.

## Lab 5
Implementation of an HLSM that will sum all the elements of an array using debouncer, seven segment and RAM modules to operate on Basys3.

## Project
Implementation of a single-cycle processor.


I hope that these answers help you in your classes. Please feel free to ask anything about my work. My email: ata.seren@hotmail.com
