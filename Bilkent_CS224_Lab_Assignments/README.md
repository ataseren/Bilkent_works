This repository contains my MIPS Assembly codes and SystemVerilog codes for Bilkent CS224 class in Spring 2021.

I wrote my MIPS Assembly codes on MARS Simulator and SystemVerilog codes on EDA Playground.

**Lab 1:** This lab tries to achieve the purposes such that learning CS224 lab rules and procedures, introduction to MIPS assembly language programming and MARS environment learning simple array processing and using multiplication and division and HI and LO registers.

**Lab 2:** This lab aims learning implementation of subprograms, use of stack in subprograms, dynamic storage allocation and bit manipulation.

**Lab 3:** This lab aims learning practicing Von Neumann's stored program concept, fundamentals of dynamic data structure construction in assembly language, implementation of recursion in assembly language.

**Lab 4:** In this lab you will use an online digital design tool, EDA Playground (https://www.edaplayground.com/), to modify the single-cycle MIPS processor. Please visit Moodle for a video and FAQ about EDAPlayground. You will expand the instruction set of the "MIPS-lite" processor by adding new instructions to it. To do this, you must first determine the RTL expressions of the new instructions then modify the datapath and control unit of the MIPS. Note that for the jr instruction datapath and controller changes will be readily available to you. Implementing the new instructions will require you to modify some SystemVerilog modules in the HDL model of the processor which is provided in the same folder as this one in Moodle. To test and prove correctness, you will simulate the microarchitecture on EDA Playground.

**Lab 5:** In this lab you will use an online digital design tool, EDA Playground (https://www.edaplayground.com/), to implement and test the Pipelined MIPS Processor and implement a hazard unit to handle possible hazards. You will be provided a skeleton SystemVerilog code for the Pipelined MIPS processor and fill the necessary parts to make it work. To do this, you must first implement the pipeline registers, then implement a datapath to make the necessary connections between the pipelines, control signals and other hardware elements, e.g, forwarding muxes, adders, etc., and finally implement the hazard unit using the logic equations discussed in class. Implementing the Pipelined MIPS Processor will require you to fill-in some SystemVerilog modules inthe HDL model of the processor which is provided in the same folder as this one in Moodle. To test and prove correctness, you will simulate the microarchitecture on EDAPlayground.

**Lab 6:** Purpose of this lab is studying the effect of various cache design parameters. The first part includes problem solving and writing a program. The second part involves execution of the program and preparing a report.

*Other than code, I uploaded my other types of answers such as questions about class topics or lab itself, results and reports and descriptions of labs.*

I hope that these answers help you in your classes. Please feel free to ask anything about my work. My email: ata.seren@hotmail.com
